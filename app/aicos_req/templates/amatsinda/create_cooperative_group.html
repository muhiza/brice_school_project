                                            This is a better way of organising cooperative's members through different sub-groups.
                                            Groups can be created according to different factors, like saving and credit groups or others that are meant to help cooperative's 
                                            members achieving their goals. <br><br>
                                            Groups can also help the management of the cooperatives to easily get reports and performance of members at lower level within their groups.
